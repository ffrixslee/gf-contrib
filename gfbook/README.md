Chapter 5:
- Utterances vs Clauses ?  
> Utterances are to-level units in a discourse, and can be sentences, questions, commands, or whatever can be said by someone in one utterance.  
> Clauses are roughly, a kind of sentences. A clause expresses a proposition, that is, a thinkable fact such as "this pizza is warm", but is neutral as whether this proposition is true or when it is true.
> Clauses can be used in utterances in many ways.
> Utt is a good start category in application grammars, because it covers many of the things one may want to express.
