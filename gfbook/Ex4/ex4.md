Exercise 4-0. Factor out a separate resource module from FoodsEng
as dened in Figure 21. Then reimplement FoodsEng by using this
resource.
Exercise 4-1. Write an abstract syntax similar to Foods but with a
dierent vocabulary, possibly describing a dierent domain. Use the
resource module created in the previous exercise to dene the concrete
syntax. Do the same with Italian, if you know enough Italian.
