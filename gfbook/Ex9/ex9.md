Exercise 9-0.* Modify the pronoun rules in such a way that the pro-drop property is implemented, i.e. that subject pronouns (which you can always assume to be unstressed) are not shown. How does this
affect parsing?


Exercise 9-1.*+ The NP coordination rule in Section A.3 doesn't treat
clitics properly: if coordinated, clitics should become stressed pronouns
that appear in the same object position as other noun phrases. For
instance, from io ti amo (\I love you") and io amo Maria (\I love
Maria") we should get io amo te e Maria (\I love you an Maria").
Getting this right requires a distinction between stressed and unstressed
pronouns. If you are familiar with this topic, you can try to x the rules;
else take a look at the actual GF resource grammar sources.

Exercise 9-2.*+ Implement the miniature resource grammar for a language
of your choice. If it is a language already included in the library,
compare its linearizations with those of the library.
This is a major assignment, which may take one or two weeks, and
provides a good start for a full-scale resource grammar implementation.
